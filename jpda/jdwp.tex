JDWP is responsible for the format of information and transfer of requests between the debugee and the debugger.
It however does not set any restricitons to transport mechanism.
\cite{oracle_jpda_jdwp}

The main benefit of the JDWP layer is that the debuggee and debugger can run on different platforms and JVMs.
It also creates the possibility of implementing the debugger side in a language other than Java.

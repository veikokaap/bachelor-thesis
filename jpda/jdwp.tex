Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) is responsible for the format of information and transfer of requests between the debugee and the debugger.
JDPW only specifies the format and layout of the protocol, but it does not set any restrictions to transport mechanism.
\cite{oracle_jpda_jdwp}

The main benefit of the JDWP layer is that the debuggee and debugger can run on different platforms and JVMs.
It also creates the possibility of implementing the debugger side in a language other than Java.

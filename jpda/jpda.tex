\toguide{What is JPDA? What does it consist of?}

"Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) is a multi-tiered debugging architecture that allows tools developers to easily create debugger applications which run portably across platforms, virtual machine (VM) implementations and JDK versions."\cite{oracle_jpda_spec} \todo{Write in your own words}

Its three layers are Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVM TI), Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) and Java Debug Interface (JDI). 
A developer who intends to use JPDA can hook into JPDA on any of these layers. \cite{oracle_jpda_spec} \todo{Use different cites for each paragraph}

Since JDI is the highest level and provides the best ease of use, then Oracle encourages developers to use that.\cite{oracle_jpda_spec}
While it is also possible to use JDWP or JVM TI and these provide more functionality, they tend to require a lot more development hours depending on the task.

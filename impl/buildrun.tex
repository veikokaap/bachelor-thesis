The proxy server is built using a build tool Maven which needs to be installed in order to build the application.
Java 8 is also required for building and running the proxy server.
Maven handles the compilation and the dependencies of the project and runs all the tests when building the application.
In order to build the proxy server, navigate to application source root and invoke command \inlinecode{mvn clean package}.

  After that, to run it, navigate to directory server-logic/target and invoke the command
  \inlinecode{java -jar server-logic-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar jvm.host=<hostname> jvm.port=<port> proxy.port=<port>}.
  If the \inlinecode{jvm.host} argument is not specified, then it defaults to address "127.0.0.1".
